Healthy skepticism
MSCHF CEO was ex Buzzfeed employee - this team is masterful at online marketing and hype
Very early on there were a number of supposed leaked texts from people who ‘got in’ but we’ve heard no confirmation since. It seems like an easy marketing tactic to stir up the ARG community with some people who ‘cracked’ it super early, this promotes the idea that ‘it can be done’ and ‘how can others have got it but not me yet’ etc. Until we know for sure that someone got in, we should assume that no one has made it in yet.
One of the earliest people who announced they got in made a reference to ‘I can’t believe how they designed this thing’ This comment deliberately makes the players think that it is a complex system or there are multiple puzzles to solve etc, this tweet felt too perfect and too soon in the process, as if it were posted to stir up second day players once the drop launched officially.
It would be very on brand for this whole ARG to be a giant troll. Where we are prisoners of this game and MSCHF are recording all the community activities to turn into some sort of future ‘drop’.
See “strong assumption that the password submission does nothing” down below; the code in the page does absolutely nothing when the server doesn’t respond with an error

Wayback machine does not seem to work on bluedonkey.co.

Ideas from Subreddit:
Strong assumption that the password submission does nothing per the JS code

Could be a url path that unlocks something

Binary code in image? (Original facebook page had this as well… not sure if same) Don't think it's relevant though due to subtle differences in color from original image (left) and the newly added zuckwatch logo (right).


Observations concerning Watergate
“Deep throat” = name of the Watergate “whistleblower”
Could be a clue
Past ‘drops’ - drops of water?
Notable watergate participants/bystanders:
 Martha Mitchell, wife of a prominent politician who was *kept locked in silence* (clue anyone?)
Richard Nixon (of course)
Roger Stone = Consultant for Trump and Nixon, subpoenaed to testify against Nixon in Watergate
Frank Wills = Security guard who discovered that the locks had been tampered with
The White House Plumbers, sometimes simply called the Plumber
Jean-Louis Palladin -- chef charged with revitalizing the Watergate Hotel with his restaurant Jean-Louis at the Watergate. Story here describes the space as a ‘windowless room’.
Texted this to Ben to which he said “He sounds very interesting”
This article references Jeremy Bentham (one who posited the panopticon) regarding the subpoena of Nixon, probably nothing
https://www.nytimes.com/1973/m 08/06/archives/subpoena-for-nixon-involves-historical-precedents-both-sides-are.html
“Woodward claimed that he would signal to "Deep Throat" that he desired a meeting by moving a flowerpot with a red flag on the balcony of his apartment. When Deep Throat wanted a meeting he would make special marks on page 20 of Woodward's copy of The New York Times; he would circle the page number and draw clock hands to indicate the hour. They often met "on the bottom level of an underground garage just over the Key Bridge in Rosslyn", at 2:00 a.m. The garage is located at 1401 Wilson Boulevard and has a historical marker that was erected in 2011. In 2014, the garage was scheduled to be demolished, though the county decided to save the historical marker, and the landowner promised to design a memorial commemorating the Watergate scandal. As of 2017, the garage had not been demolished.” Wikipedia watergate page
Do any of the number announcements work with the codes that these two used to communicate?

Random Observations:
The ClickSwipe Privacy Policy page was offline as of 9AM PST Monday. It came back online around 11AM PST.
The Privacy Policy contains a surprising amount of detail about tracking cookies and Adobe Flash cookies.
Adobe Flash Cookies are stored on macs at this location: ~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash Player/#SharedObjects/<some random string>/
Gabriel Whaley (CEO) Tweeted about privacy policy day  (3:30 pst)
If it’s anything to do with 9/11, the Patriot Act came in soon after
The highest ‘level’ on the SMS line we’ve seen someone get is level 3.
Gabriel (CEO) just tweeted about Level 7.
He followed up this tweet with another tweet including the hashtag
Gabriel has deleted his twitter? It’s back
Multiple gabe tweets including “windowless rooms” presumed to be cells
It is Aquarius season, Facebook's sign is Aquarius in the Bull and Moon app produced by MSCHF
Zuckerberg’s old password that he was hacked with is ‘dadada’
Clickswipe was removed from mschf.xyz at the time of the drop
It’s back
The “XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX” thing is “restricted”
Ben said that we need to dig deeper than the restricted one
The restricted project here was The Blue Donkey - The Blue Donkey
Blue donkey is the democratic symbol
The restricted file was released on Nov. 26, 2019
Is that date important?
Gabriel (CEO) tweeted (@Gabriel_Whaley now deleted undeleted) ‘windowless rooms’ - could be a reference to this tweet from Hillary Clinton? (this has been partially confirmed to be about prison cells)
Hillary Clinton on Twitter: "Because I have a life you can't make up: as a young lawyer I worked on the Watergate impeachment inquiry. One of my jobs was to sit alone in a windowless room and listen very carefully to tapes of President Nixon's phone calls. #tbt… https://t.co/MYjRTyEiaQ"
Windowless rooms could refer to server rooms or VR headsets (Oculus owned by FB)
Gabriel Whaley tweeted at Mark Zuck about data privacy day (the day zuckwatch was released)
Maybe a connection to the number 5
Someone was told about act 4:4 which has “five thousand” at the end of it
The m-journal.org watergate page has “five men” in the beginning paragraph of the document
The official number is 917-905-1865
The recurrence of 1445 or 4155
Every time I mention something about 5 to be he never answers if there is or isn’t, but rather answers the next or previous question I asked, almost as if he ignored it.
All the acts that have been mentioned so far, i.e. act 16:27 and act 4:4 has to do with Peter and Peter has 5 letters in his name.
On jesus.shoes a quote reads, “And in the fourth match of the night he came to them walking on the sea.” Matthew 14:25
When you press the “!” at mschf.xyz at the bottom, the character “&” is just sitting there.
The password form is completely written in HTML which makes it static so it would be really hard to have password confirmation on this website.
MSCHF was established in 2016 but zuckwatch.com has a MSCHF © 2004
Is that anything besides the year Facebook was founded?
Deep Throat is the Watergate whistle blower’s “name” and also a Trojan virus (the laptop full of viruses drop)
Its B.E.N.(B.E.N) not Ben.

I(who?) got a text from ben yesterday, but it was a screenshot of text instead of a written text message(and what did it say?)


Technical details (probably irrelevant):
Main URL:
https://zuckwatch.com/
URL passwords are sent to:
https://k1ozwahixa.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/password
Method: POST
Data: {"password":"<your password>"}
Incorrect passwords result in a 400 Bad Request status, response content length of 0;
They’re using Amazon’s DynamoDB
DynamoDB is doing UpdateTable action, does not seem to be actually checking the password.
Curiously, when the password submitted is empty, the response itself returns a 200 OK status, but the response is the following JSON:
{
"message": "One or more parameter values were invalid:
An AttributeValue may not contain an empty string",
"code": "ValidationException",
"time": "<time>",
"requestId": "<ID>",
"statusCode": 400,
"Retryable": false,
"retryDelay": 23.56660291028836
}
However that shouldn’t mean much, as it seems to be a standard DynamoDB response; example.
